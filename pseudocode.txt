initialize a variable to Random.new()

loop until both players have > 0 lives
  generate two random numbers
  print a question to add the two numbers
  get input from the user
  if input matches the sum
    increment player1 score for even count
    increment player2 score for odd count
    increment the count
  else

    decrement player1 life for even count
    decrement player2 life for odd count

if player1 score is greater than playerw score
  print player1 won the game and the respective scores
else
  print player2 won the game and the respective scores
